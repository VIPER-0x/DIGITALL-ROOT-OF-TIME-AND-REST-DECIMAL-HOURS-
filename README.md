# Digital Root Checker

## Overview
The **Digital Root Checker** is a C# console application that continuously calculates and displays the passed time and remaining time until midnight in a day. It computes the digital roots of both times and checks them against a specified target digital root, providing real-time feedback on whether they match.

## Features
- Calculates the passed time and remaining time dynamically every second.
- Computes the digital roots of the passed and remaining time.
- Checks if the digital roots match a specified target and displays the result.
- Updates the console with the latest information every second.

## Requirements
- .NET SDK (version 5.0 or later recommended)
- C# compatible IDE (like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DigitalRootChecker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd DigitalRootChecker
   ```

3. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment.

## How to Use
1. Open the `DigitalRootChecker.cs` file in your C# IDE.
2. You can modify the `targetRoot` variable in the `Main` method to set your desired target digital root to check against.
3. Build and run the application. 
4. The console will display:
   - The passed time since midnight.
   - The remaining time until midnight.
   - The digital roots of both times.
   - Whether the digital roots match the target root.

## Code Explanation
- **CalculateDigitalRoot(int number)**: Computes the digital root of a given integer by summing its digits until a single-digit result is obtained.
  
- **CheckDigitalRoot(decimal hours, int targetRoot)**: Checks if the digital root of the given decimal hours matches the specified target root.

- **Main()**: The entry point of the application. It:
  - Retrieves the current time.
  - Calculates the passed and remaining hours.
  - Computes the digital roots of passed and remaining hours.
  - Displays the results on the console.
  - Continuously updates every second.

## Example Output
```
Passed Time: 03.25 hours
Remaining Time: 20.75 hours
Digital Root of Passed Time: 5
Digital Root of Remaining Time: 8
Match for Passed Time Digital Root (Target: 7): False
Match for Remaining Time Digital Root (Target: 7): False
```
